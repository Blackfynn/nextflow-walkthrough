# Simple Cell Detection with Docker, Nextflow, and AWS Batch

## About
This repository contains code for a walkthrough of a simple computational pipeline for cell-detection using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), and [AWS Batch](https://aws.amazon.com/batch/)

## Getting Started

In order to get started you'll need to have the following installed:

* [Java 8 or higher](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
* [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html#installation)
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) (if running on MacOSX [Docker For Mac](https://www.docker.com/docker-mac) is recommended)

#### Optional (for running the pipeline in AWS Batch)
* [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/account/)
* [AWS credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/setup-credentials.html) setup locally
* [AWS Command-line interface (CLI)](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
